<!-- Definition Statement -->
I want to build an application that allows users to experience a hassle free option to plan a vacation or business trip.

<!-- Definition of Audience -->
Are you tired of spending unnecessary fees on a trip planner? What about using multiple applications to ensure your trip reaches it full potential? If your answer is "Yes" to either one of these questions then this application would be a perfect fit for you!

<!-- Outline of content -->
<!-- What do I want on each page? (text / pics / images / navigation) -->
- First page needs to be aesthetically pleasing with a modern look. I want it to include a search bar and several pics of different places around the world to get the ball rolling for the user to think about where it is they want to take their vacation. It also needs to have different navigation tabs to quickly direct the user to the other 4 pages of the application.
- Second Page needs to be the result of the user entering a specific city, state, or country from the home page. This page should show all of the available vacation home/hotel rental options for the specific area.
- Third page needs to show dining options near the choice of vacation rental. I would like it to present a visual map with an eta of how far each local dining option is from the vacation rental. Each dining option should include a rating from 1-5 stars with a review option to browse past reviews of travelers and a section that allows a review from the current user.
- Fourth page needs to show attraction/Things to do options near the choice of vacation rental. I would like it to also present a visual map with an eta of how far each local attraction option is from the vacation rental. Each attraction option should also include a rating from 1-5 stars with a review option to browse past reviews of travelers and a section that allows a review from the current user.
- Fifth page needs to show a list of available flights with pricing included along with different flight companies labeled. It needs to include distance and travel time with each different flight option.
- Sixth page needs to show Cart/Checkout summary of each choice that was picked from flight, vacation rental, dining, and attraction options with total price. It also needs to include an option to edit an item in cart and remove an item from the cart.
- Seventh page needs to be an about us page. Providing the user some insight of the purpose of the application.

- Geolocation and map feature
